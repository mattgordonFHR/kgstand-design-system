# KGStand Design System
The KGStand Design system is intended to be our one source of truth for rapid development and prototyping for Koch Global Solutions

This repository is intended to be your one stop shop for leveraging our shared components or our style sheets for however you needs might be.

# Architecture
KGStand DS is developed with designers and developers in mind, following the guidlines of Atomic Design and functional component development practices.

We utilize Storybook to demo and document our shared components as well as the markup structure for usage with our styles.

`/shared-components` - shared atomic design elements/components
`/stories` - storybook
